### Problem Solved

Keeping track of which words and sentence structures you have learnt in a language. 

### Technologies Used

We chose React because the team was interested in learning it. The Chingu voyage was a great opportunity to work and learn together.

### Challenges Faced

The short production time meant that we would only be able to manage a basic MVP. We made a list of features that would be useful and split their production out across the team. 

### Lessons Learned

The importance of automated testing. Direct usage of the app is a poor way to test it after changes that are potentially breaking. I've since used TDD on projects I made in teams at Makers.
