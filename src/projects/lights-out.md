### Problem Solved

I used to enjoy playing this game back in the 1980s, and decided to recreate it as a web app. The aim was to include it among the games I let students play at the end of maths lessons -- these needed to be intellectual, problem solving games. This had the added benefit of using pattern recognition to aid in moving from simple (one or two move problems) into more complex problems.

### Technologies Used

The interface is written in `VueJS`. I added the animation (with `GSAP`) because students were finding it difficult to understand what was going on from verbal or written instructions. Once the animations highlighted what was changing, everything became clear to them almost at first sight.

### Challenges Faced

This was my first proper Vue project, made as part of an interview process actually. The recruiter had seen the React version and asked for this to be rewritten in Vue (which is the library used by the company in question). 

### Lessons Learned

Get as much user feedback as possible before considering a project as viable. Using animation to highlight changes saves many words of explanation.
